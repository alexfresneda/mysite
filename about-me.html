      <h1>Hey, I'm Alex üëã</h1>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm a design engineer currently designing and managing digital products
        at Backslash Build.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I was born in Spain, where I lived for 18 years before moving to the UK.
        I went to school at Ramiro de Maeztu, a bilingual school where I studied
        half of my subjects in German. There, I studied International
        Baccalaureate (IB), which motivated me to go to university abroad.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Before joining Backslash Build, I studied
        <a class="in-text" href="design-engineering.html">Design Engineering</a>
        at The University of Bath, where I graduated from my Masters course with
        First Class Honours. On my third year, I completed a year-long
        internship in the Advanced Engineering department at SAIC Motor
        Technical Centre UK (SMTC UK), a satellite office of SAIC Motor. Based
        in Birmingham, SMTC UK was the old home of the classic British brands MG
        and Rover, acquired by Chinese SAIC Motor a few years ago.

        During my internship, I was involved in multiple projects from vehicle
        packaging to concept car visualisation in VR. Also as part of the
        internship, and together with other 9 interns, I worked on the
        <a class="in-text" href="design-engineering/mgzs.html"
          >electrification of a conventional car</a
        >.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Outside of work, I like to spend my free time playing sports, music and
        working on side projects.
      </p>

        Back in Spain, I played in the academy of the professional basketball
        team,
        <a class="in-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB_Estudiantes"
          >Estudiantes</a
        >. Later, during my time at University, I played for Bath's 1st Team in
        Division 1, and was awarded Best Defensive Player in 2019 and MVP of the
        team in 2020.

        I also enjoy playing guitar (acoustic and electric) on my own or with
        friends. Occasionally, I join my dad and his friends as lead guitar.
        We've played a few times in pubs and even recorded a live album with
        original songs, available on
