      <h1>Spherical robot</h1>
      <p>
        This mechatronics project combined mechanics, software and electronics
        to design a semi-autonomous spherical robot. The scenery of the project
        was set around Mars, where our spherical robot performed a set of tasks
        on a daily basis, which included checking a potato plantation and
        a weather station on Mars. However, one day, one of our satellites
        detected the presence of unknown beings landing on Mars and decided to
        guide the spherical robot to the location of the aliens to try to learn
        more about them...
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the Mechatronics Design Project II at The University of
        Bath my team was challenged to design and build a semi-autonomous
        spherical robot. The project required the robot to be able to be
        controlled manually from a laptop, navigate semi-autonomously using an
        on-board JeVois camera and communicate via WiFi with a secondary robot.
        With the aim of making the project more realistic, each team had to
        design an event to be mitigated by the robot. In our case, the event
        consisted in the landing of aliens on Mars.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        The design process was divided into 3 stages: ​<br /><br /><b
          >Manual Drive.</b
        ><br />For this stage, I programmed a Python script and a Simulink model
        that allowed manual control of the spherical robot. The robot was driven
        from the keyboard of a laptop and the signals were sent over wifi to
        the onboard Arduino MKR1000. ​ <br /><br /><b>Autonomous Drive.</b
        ><br />At this stage, the spherical robot was able to navigate
        autonomously to the potato plantation and weather station, using
        ArUco markers (similar to QR codes) as points of reference in a closed
        environment. My role during this stage was to process the signals
        received from an onboard JeVois camera and translate them into driving
        commands using a Simulink model. <br /><br /><b
          >Stellite Communications.</b
        ><br />For the final stage, I modified the Simulink model to allow
        bi-directional WiFi communication between the spherical robot and the
        satellite. This way, the satellite, having identified the position of
        the aliens, could direct the spherical robot towards them. ​
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Simulink Model</h2>
      <p>
        The Simulink model shown below was used to operate the robot manually,
        autonomously and from the satellite. It contains a manual drive
        controller, a 'black box' including all the image processing (which was
        designed by another team member), WiFi receiver and sender to
        communicate with the satellite, a Finite State Machine to translate the
        robot's vision into motor commands and two motor controllers with
        PID control. 
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>From Image Processing...</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>... to Drive Commands...</h2>
      <p>
        The Finite State Machine (FSM) below was designed to convert the
        readings from the JeVois camera into drive commands. It was designed
        using Simulink and embedded in the Arduino MKR1000 onboard of the
        spherical robot. 
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>... to Motor Signals...</h2>
      <p>
        The diagram below was part of the Simulink model embedded in the
        spherical robot. It represents the FSM that read the driving commands
        from the previous FSM and converted them into PWM signals to the
        motors.   
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Navigation Sequence</h2>
      <p>
        Apart from the spherical robot, a satellite robot was designed. The
        satellite consisted of a JeVois camera, an Arduino MKR1000 and a laser
        mounted on a 2-axis turret. The purpose of the satellite was to detect
        when the aliens landed and to use the laser to eliminate the aliens if
        they were considered a danger. <br /><br />

        1. While the robot is performing its fixed route between the weather
        station and the plantation, the satellite detects two unidentified
        aliens in the surroundings.​​​​​​ ​<br />

        2. Having computed the distance from the robot to each alien, the
        satellite interrupts the robot actions and directs it towards the
        closest alien. ​​<br />

        3. Once the desired distance to the target is achieved, the robot scans
        the face of the alien. ​​<br />

        4. If a bad alien is detected, the robot sends a signal to the
        satellite, which triggers the elimination procedure – a laser pointed at
        the alien. ​​<br />

        5. The satellite then computes the quickest path to the second alien.
        ​​<br />

        6. If an obstacle is detected on the way of the quickest path, the
        satellite designs an alternative path to avoid the obstacle (i.e. it
        sends an alternative coordinate point). ​​<br />

        7. Once the robot reaches the alternative point, the satellite checks
        that the obstacle is no longer impeding the quickest route and the robot
        can approach the second alien. ​​<br />

        8. Once the desired distance to the second target is achieved, the robot
        scans the face of the alien. ​​<br />

        9. If a good alien is detected, the robot greets the alien with a
        friendly dance.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>
        The robot designed managed to complete the entire navigation sequence
        during the demo day at University and was awarded the highest grade in
        the course.
