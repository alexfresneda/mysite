      <h1>Automotive Electrification Project</h1>
      <p>
        MG ZS 4WD PHEV was a prototype hybrid vehicle designed and built from a
        conventional SUV. The final product, fully designed, tested and built by
        interns, improved the original vehicle’s efficiency by adding a 15-mile
        range with zero emissions, as well as four-wheel drive (4WD) capability
        to improve performance in adverse weather conditions. The vehicle
        was able to regenerate electricity during braking and was charged
        through a domestic socket.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Car manufacturers are more than ever looking into alternative and
        greener solutions to reduce vehicle emissions to meet the targets
        imposed by the new WLTP cycle. Executive Committee members of SAIC Motor
        challenged a group of 10 interns to convert a conventional MG SUV into a
        4WD Hybrid Vehicle. As Project Manager, I was accountable for the final
        product. Due to the project scope being purposely vague, we were
        responsible for developing our own specification, which required
        in-depth research and benchmarking during the initial phase. 
      </p>

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        The various challenges included modifying the rear suspension of the
        vehicle to allow for a driven axle, design, purchase and packaging of
        the electric powertrain and the control system. My role as Project
        Manager consisted in overviewing the design process, ensuring that all
        parts were designed, built and tested to match the quality expected
        by the Executive Committee. Leading our team meetings, dealing with
        suppliers and reporting on a regular basis to our stakeholders were also
        my responsibilities.

      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>
        The final product improved the original vehicle’s efficiency by adding a
        15-mile range with zero emissions, as well as 4WD capability to improve
        performance in adverse weather conditions. The vehicle was able to
        regenerate electricity during braking and could be charged by plugging
        it to a domestic socket. The project was completed in time, under the
        budget limit and created a great impression amongst the Executive
        Committee members.
