      <h1>Yogo</h1>
      <p>
        Yogo was a prototype yogurt vending machine that I designed and built as
        part my Design Engineering Maters at the University of Bath. As a person
        who eats snacks frequently, it always annoys me how vending machines
        only offer unhealthy products. Not only this, they also fail to fill me
        as much as I would expect them to. Based on that problem, I decided to
        do my final year project on designing a vending machine that provides
        healthier and nutritionally denser snacks.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was to find the perfect snack. I somehow convinced
        over a hundred people to fill in a survey to understand more about
        snacking habits. This was followed by a few face-to-face interviews to
        dive deeper into questions that had come up from the survey. All this
        research, combined with some market research and feasibility studies led
        to my decision of building a yogurt vending machine. One of the key
        findings was that people have quite varied snacking habits, in terms of
        ingredients and portion size. So to conclude the research phase, I set
        the target to design a vending machine that served yogurt that could be
        customised with different toppings and sizes.

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the project was to build a functional prototype of the
        machine. To start, I focused on the yogurt dispenser. This involved
        research in the areas of packaging, storage and dispensing. Multiple
        concepts and iterations were designed and the final choice was a rolling
        pin that rolled down using a lead-screw and squeezed the yogurt out of a
        disposable plastic pouch.

      </div>

      <p>
        I then moved on to designing the second subsystem: a granola dispenser.
        For this, I designed an archimedes screw. The screw, subject to the
        rotation of a stepper motor provided a great solution to dispense
        granola accurately and continuously.<br /><br />Both subsystems were
        designed in Fusion 360 and built with laser cut plywood and custom 3D
        printed parts.

      <p>
        I used an Arduino Mega to control all sensors and actuators. Two
        ultrasonic sensors were used to detect when a cup was placed under the
        yogurt and granola dispensers. A load cell and an analogue to digital
        converter voltage amplifier were used to detect the weight of the cup
        and close the feedback loop. This allowed users to enter their desired
        yogurt and granola amounts, and let the system do the rest.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the prototype couldn't be completed due to the closure of
        the University's installations because of COVID19. As a result, a
        conveyor belt couldn't be built to move the cup between the yogurt and
        granola dispensers.
      </p>

      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>
        The closure of the University less than 2 months into the project forced
        me to change the plans for the month that we had left to complete the
        project. Although I could still work on the software, I couldn't make
        any improvements to the hardware at that point. Instead, I worked on a
        concept design for the entire machine and a mobile app for users to
        order their snacks from their phones. For the machine concept design, I
        aimed to find the optimum layout for an optimised packaging of the
        subsystems, taking into consideration things like refrigeration and
        refilling of toppings.

        Time constraints limited the amount of work I could put into the mobile
        app. I had already created a basic GUI on Simulink to control the
        prototype machine, so I decided to focus on designing the user interface
        and experience. This was my first time designing a digital interface. I
        did some user research with low-fidelity paper wireframes to investigate
        different concepts for the interface. I then applied what I learnt from
        user research and other design principles to a high fidelity prototype
        using InVision Studio.

        Overall, this project was a great experience, where I was able to apply
        all my learning from the previous years at University. Being able to
        combine hardware, software, electronics and design into a single
        prototype was a great way of showcasing the skills I had gained while at
        University.
