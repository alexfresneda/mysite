      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the User Centred Design module taught at the University of
        Bath, and in collaboration with the design
        consultancy Designability, the challenge was to create a product that
        would help a disabled user improve his experience in and around the
        kitchen.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The User</h2>
      <p>
        Andrew, 62, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease 6 years previously.
        His main symptoms are reduced hand dexterity, balance and leg mobility. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks to a series of interviews with Andrew, and following a
        user-centred design approach, a drinks’ tray was designed to help with
        the transport of liquids, especially hot ones. Multiple low fidelity
        prototypes were created and presented to Andrew, who provided feedback
        that was used to guide the design of the final product. By following a
        design-with-purpose philosophy, the tray included a series of features
        that made it a safer and more comfortable alternative to existing trays
        in the market.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>
        Quattray was the result of four weeks of intense work put into
        developing an elegant solution for the transport of hot drinks. The
        final product was presented to Andrew, who really believed the tray
        would solve his difficulties to transport liquids. The product included
        various features that made the transport of liquids easier and safer for
        Andrew and other users with hand dexterity problems.
