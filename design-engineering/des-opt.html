      <h1>Design Optimisation</h1>
      <p>
        This project consisted in the design and optimisation of a micro wind
        turbine. Combining aerodynamics principles, data analysis and
        simulations in MATLAB, a set of blades was designed in Autodesk
        Inventor, built and tested to optimise for maximum power output.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        For the Design Optimisation course at The University of Bath, I was
        challenged to design the optimum set of blades for a micro wind turbine.
        The challenge included various constraints such as a maximum rotor
        diameter of 1 meter. The final design had to be tested in the University
        Labs and the performance would be evaluated in terms of Voltage, Current
        and Rotor Speed. 
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, aerodynamic theory research was carried out to familiarise
        with the theory behind the operation of wind turbines. After this, a
        full-factorial experiment was conducted using design of experiments,
        followed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine which factors had
        a significant impact on the output of a wind turbine. Based on the
        theoretical research and the experimental results, a suitable aerofoil
        profile was selected to optimise performance for the given testing
        scenario. Following this, MATLAB was used to obtain the optimum
        dimensions of the blade using Blade Element Momentum Theory.
        <br /><br />
        The results from the MATLAB simulations guided the design of the first
        set of blades. In order to validate the results from the simulations, a
        model of the rotor was built and tested. After testing the initial set,
        improvements were carried out to increase the speed of rotation. This
        was done by analysing the data collected during the experiments
        and modifying the simulations accordingly to approximate the MATLAB
        model to reality.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>
        The final set of blades, which was built combining a laser-cut MDF
        structure with 3D printed material and wrapped with lightweight tape
        (left rotor on the left picture), achieved a maximum rotational speed of
        410 rpm. It achieved the highest speed of the course, which was
        considered a success. Upon reflection, it was clear that the selection
        of a thinner aerofoil and lightweight materials had a significant impact
        on performance.
