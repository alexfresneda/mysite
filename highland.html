      <h1>Clothing Brand</h1>
      <p>
        Highland Clothing was a clothing brand created along with a peer during
        High School. With special focus on design and affordable prices,
        Highland quickly gained attraction from students at our school. Within a
        few months, the brand, solely advertised through social media and word
        of mouth, expanded nationally and clothes were sold and sent all around
        Spain, and even got the attention from international customers.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Back in 2014, during High School, a friend and I realised the struggle
        that was to get fashionable apparel for an affordable price. After
        understanding that it was a common problem amongst students both at High
        School and University, we decided to start our own clothing company. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        Start small, think big. With that moto in mind, we invested our own
        savings into the company. The first steps involved the design of a
        recognisable logo and a name. Finding a common theme that students
        and young people in general would feel identified with was key: Freedom
        & Skateboarding. We focused on designing different combinations of brand
        name and logo with trendy colours and patterns. All our marketing effort
        was put into Influencer Marketing, via Instagram and Facebook, with the
        aim of targeting teenagers.

      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>
        The simple and attractive design of our clothing line, which included
        sweatshirts, hoodies, t-shirts and hats attracted lots of teenagers from
        all around Spain. Less than a year after creating Highland Clothing, our
        Instagram account had more than 2.5k followers and clothes were sold on
        a daily basis.
        <br /><br />
        This project was a truly rewarding experience as it was my first
        'real-life' project. But most important were the learning outcomes
        associated with starting my own business.
